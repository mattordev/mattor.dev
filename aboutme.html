          <h1>About me</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm Matthew Roberts, a 25 year old game developer, mainly
            specialising in programming and software development. I have been
            developing and playing with code, games, software and hardware for
            as long as I can remember.

            Over the years of learning and often teaching I have fostered my
            ability to be a hardworking individual who can adapt to a multitude
            of different situations, never being detered by any challenge that
            seems tricky at first, which has helped me develop the wide range of
            <a href="/skills.html">skills</a> such as C#, Python, Web, Unity
            Development and Advanced Version Control Practises. On top of this,
            because of the various team projects I've been a part of, I've
            gained a fully founded understanding of the Agile practice, conflict
            resolution and communication skills which allow me to stand out and
            excel in my goals and tasks. It's always been of great interest to
            me how things work beyond the pretty interfaces and UI, and when you
            pair that idea with my general love for games and technology you can
            see why I chose to persue this field.

            I've had many different types of hobbies ranging from metal
            detecting, making music and streaming all the way to something as
            far out as model rocketry and designing flight computers to control
            and guide said model rockets. Besides those, I've held a strong
            passion for gaming for as long as I can remember and have been
            playing them for over a decade. Offline, I love to explore the
            environments and try to promote healthy development by going on bike
            rides, walking trails and getting out as much as I can.
