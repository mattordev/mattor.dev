          <h1>About me</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm Matthew Roberts, a 22 year old game developer, mainly
            specialising in programming and software development. I have been
            developing and playing with code, games, software and hardware for
            as long as I can remember.
          </p>

            It's always been of great interest to me how things work beyond the
            pretty interfaces and UI, when you pair that idea with my general
            love for games and technology you can see why I chose to persue this
            field. Over the years of learning and often teaching I have fostered
            my ability to be a hardworking indvidual who can apdapt to a
            multitude of different situations, never being detered by any
            challenge that seems tricky at first.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years I've had many different types of hobbies ranging from
            metal detecting, making music and streaming all the way to something
            as far out as model rocketry and designing flight computers to
            control and guide said model rockets. Besides those, I've had a
            passion for gaming for as long as I can remember and have been
            playing them for over a decade. Besides those things, I love to
            explore the environments in the real world and try and promote
            healthy development by going on bike rides, walking trials and
            getting out as much as I can.
          </p>

            To see more of my adventures outside, I try and post about them on
            my twitter which you can find on the links page on my site.
