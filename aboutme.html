          <br />
          <p>
            I'm Matthew Roberts, a 22 year old game developer, mainly
            specialising in programming and software development. I have been
            developing and playing with code, games, software and hardware for
            as long as I can remember.

            It's always been of great interest to me how things work beyond the
            pretty interfaces and UI, when you pair that idea with my general
            love for games and technology you can see why I chose to persue this
            field. Over the years of learning and often teaching I have fostered
            my ability to be a hardworking individual who can adapt to a
            multitude of different situations, never being detered by any
            challenge that seems tricky at first.
          </p>

            I've had many different types of hobbies ranging from metal
            detecting, making music and streaming all the way to something as
            far out as model rocketry and designing flight computers to control
            and guide said model rockets. Besides those, I've held a strong
            passion for gaming for as long as I can remember and have been
            playing them for over a decade. Offline, I love to explore the
            environments and try to promote healthy development by going on bike
            rides, walking trails and getting out as much as I can.
          </p>

            To see more of my adventures outside, I try and post about them on
            my twitter which you can find on the links page on my site.
