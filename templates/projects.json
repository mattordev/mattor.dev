So, to that extent please keep in mind that the project is unfinished, and may never get finished regardless of my own personal plans for it (which are to keep working on it)"

				"description": "Overall there was a lot that went right with this project. But it's important to reflect on what I could've done differently throughout the projects duration to avoid making the same mistakes.\n Firstly, what went right? <ul style=\"list-style-type:square\"><li>I correctly simulated physics! This was one of the harder challenges for this entire project. But I managed to actually do it!</li><li>Full statistic tracking for the entire simulation! Each body can be focused on to see its stats as they update live.</li><li>A *pretty* in-depth tool set: Most of the simulation, it's bodies and parameters can be tweaked and changed using the in-sim tools.</li></ul>\n So now we know what went right, what would I do differently? <ul style=\"list-style-type:square\"><li>Time management: Looking back on the project as the deadline approached, I came to the conclusion that I spent too long on some of the simpler features and neglected some of the more important features that I initially set out to get into the simulation. This meant towards the end of the project, it was much more stressful than what it needed to be.</li><li>Overscoping, the forever problem: From the get go, I tried to keep the projects features in scope but this increasingly became and afterthought as I got closer to the deadline. Meaning that more features got cut than what I had orignally planned for.</li><li>Overscoping from the get go: At the start of the project, I tried to keep the list of features low, but rich. This train of thought was hard to maintain throughout the many months of development and at times was forgotten as one feature might have required 2 more in order to function properly. It's aspects of a project like these that are very easy to overlook and ones that I need to keep in mind next time</li></ul>"
